# Backend Test Coverage Task List

This document tracks the progress of increasing backend test coverage, focusing on one file at a time. Each task represents a specific test file to create or enhance. After each test creation task, we run all tests to ensure nothing breaks.

## Instructions for Maintaining This Document

1. After completing a task, mark it as `[x]` instead of `[ ]`
2. Add the date completed next to the task
3. Update the coverage percentage after running tests
4. Add any notes about issues encountered or additional tests needed
5. Keep the current coverage metrics updated at the top
