# Backend Test Coverage Task List

This document tracks the progress of increasing backend test coverage, focusing on one file at a time. Each task represents a specific test file to create or enhance. After each test creation task, we run all tests to ensure nothing breaks.

## Instructions for Maintaining This Document

1. After completing a task, mark it as `[x]` instead of `[ ]`
2. Add the date completed next to the task
3. Update the coverage percentage after running tests
4. Add any notes about issues encountered or additional tests needed
5. Keep the current coverage metrics updated at the top

### Common Issues and Solutions
- Mock external API calls (Stash GraphQL, OpenAI)
- Use pytest fixtures for database setup/teardown
- Test both success and error paths
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions
- Mock WebSocket connections for real-time features
- Use transaction rollback to maintain test isolation

### Testing Best Practices
- Create comprehensive test fixtures for models
- Test API endpoints with various authentication states
- Verify database constraints and validations
- Test concurrent operations and race conditions
- Include performance tests for batch operations
- Mock all external service calls

### Application Context Update
The StashHog application has evolved to include:
- Enhanced scene file management with multiple files per scene
- Comprehensive analysis planning with bulk operations
- Advanced sync functionality with conflict resolution
- Real-time progress tracking via WebSockets
- Cost tracking for AI operations
- Scheduled task management with cron support
- Improved error handling and retry mechanisms
